# SRFI-105 experimental implementation for Sagittarius

## How to use?

    #< (srfi :105) >
    (print '{a + b})

This library does not support #!srfi-105 or other #!curly-foo sh-bang. So users
need to use Sagittarius specific reader macro import.

## Caution

This SRFI is not final yet, so it has high possibility to change.
